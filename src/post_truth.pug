        h1(class="h1") 1917-2017: DISCIPLINARY REGIMES OF TRUTH
        h2(class="h2") 30 SEPTEMBER – 1 OCTOBER 2017
        h3(class="h3 h3_right") The second annual Humanities and Social Sciences Landscape forum will be devoted to the notion of truth in its historical and disciplinary dimensions. We plan to discuss a number of general problems and to zoom in on the case of the Russian Revolution.

          li(class="list__item list__item_margined") It has been claimed that the Russian Revolution and the subsequent development of socialist world transformed the basic notions of truth in politics, history, anthropology and culture. The global collapse of socialism transformed them again. How can these paradigm shifts be described from different disciplinary perspectives?

                    p(class="modal-window__p") What began as an interest in the spectacular exhibitions of Russian stage design eventually became a multi-year study of exhibitions of avant-garde Russian art in the United States during the 20th century. Although my research continues, at this time the finding of most interest to me has been the way in which curators and donors have reshaped the meaning of Russian art, either for political, social or mercantile purposes. These exhibitions have, in many respects, served as a Rorschach test in terms of what they reveal about the American relationship with Russia. Thus, this study has opened my eyes to the interference of exhibition politics in the interpretation of art. Because I have been involved in compiling this history for some time, the part that interests me the most at this time is the part of my research that comes near the end. How did these exhibitions change in the years of block-buster exhibitions? How 
                    did the MoMA exhibition of deconstructivist architecture inspire a new interest in constructivism even as it completely misunderstood what that movement was about? And how did the art-world phenomenon of post-movements affect exhibitions of constructivism – just what is “neo- constructivism,” anyway?
